The stepfather's 3D multiplayer game has the following rules: 1. Players will play as stick figures in different roles, which are either capturers or captives, assigned randomly by the game and controlled through the keyboard for movement. 2. Each captive starts with 3 lives; every time they are caught, they lose one life, and after losing all 3 lives, they automatically become a capturer. 3. The game features a starting area and a safe zone, where each captive can enter the safe zone 2 times per round, with a maximum of 20 seconds per entry; capturers cannot enter the safe zone. 4. Each round of the game is limited to 10 minutes; captives only win if they enter the safe zone within the last 20 seconds. 5. The game map will include various obstacles and hiding places for the captives. Movement will be controlled using the arrow keys and WASD keys, and the character design should be replaced with stick figures instead of simple cones. During the competition, players can switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, and the game rules and agreements should be displayed before the game starts.
